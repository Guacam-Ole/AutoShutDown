# Using the UI

After starting the application you will find a new icon in the system tray:

On first start you might also get a warning that AutoShutDown isn't configured yet.

## Configuring AutoShutDown
Right-Click onto the icon and select "Change Settings". A new window will appear. If you are unsure about any of those options just hover with the mouse about the setting and a Tooltop will appaar. After changing the settings exit AutoShutDown using the "Exit" Menu of the tray icon and restart it.

## Showing Overlay
If you have trust issues :) or just want to see what is happening. You can show an overlay. This will show you what of the conditions you entered in the settings are met. That's about it.
