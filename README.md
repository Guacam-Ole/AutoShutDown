# AutoShutDown
This is a small tool to automatically shutdown the computer if downloads are finished and/or no mouse movement detected

## Using the UI
Using the UI is the most comfortable way and works best when using the Windows Task Scheduler. The documentation can be found here: https://github.com/Guacam-Ole/AutoShutDown/tree/master/AutoShutDownUI

## Using the Console
You can use the console application instead by just adding the wanted startup-parameters. Documentation for using the console can be found at https://github.com/Guacam-Ole/AutoShutDown/tree/master/AutoShutDownConsole
